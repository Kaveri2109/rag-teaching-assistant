"""
Hybrid retrieval pipeline: FAISS dense search + BM25 keyword search,
fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, then refined with a cross-encoder reranker.

(Kaveri Anil Ghatage - RAG Teaching Assistant)

WHY HYBRID RETRIEVAL, so you can explain this in an interview:
- FAISS (dense/semantic search) is great at understanding MEANING. It will
  match "how do I make text bold" to a chunk that says "use the <strong> tag"
  even with zero overlapping words, because the embeddings capture meaning.
- BM25 (sparse/keyword search) is great at EXACT terms. If a student asks
  "what is z-index", BM25 reliably surfaces chunks that literally contain
  "z-index" - something dense search can sometimes under-rank if the
  embedding model wasn't trained heavily on that exact jargon.
- Using both and fusing the results covers each method's blind spot.

WHY RECIPROCAL RANK FUSION (RRF), not just averaging scores:
FAISS returns inner-product scores; BM25 returns TF-IDF-based scores. These
two scales are NOT comparable (e.g. FAISS might range 0-1, BM25 might range
0-20) so averaging them directly is meaningless without careful tuning.
RRF sidesteps this entirely: it only looks at each chunk's RANK in each
list (1st place, 2nd place, ...), not the raw score. A chunk ranked #1 in
both lists scores higher than one ranked #1 in only one list. This is the
same fusion technique used in real hybrid search systems (e.g. Elasticsearch
8.8+'s RRF retriever).

WHY A CROSS-ENCODER ON TOP OF THAT:
FAISS and BM25 are both "fast but approximate" - they embed/score the query
and each document SEPARATELY, then compare. A cross-encoder instead reads
the query and a candidate chunk TOGETHER in one forward pass, so it can
catch relationships a separate-embedding approach misses. It's too slow to
run against all 7,252 chunks, so we only rerank the ~15 candidates RRF
already shortlisted - this is the standard "retrieve cheap, rerank precise"
pattern used in production search systems.
