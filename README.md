Intelligent Q&A system for educational videos using Retrieval-Augmented Generation, with hybrid (dense + keyword) retrieval and cross-encoder reranking.

## Overview
Processes real lecture video content (7,252 chunks transcribed from 18 real videos via Whisper) into a queryable Q&A system. Given a question, it retrieves the most relevant lecture moments and answers with the exact video and timestamp.

## Architecture

```
Lecture videos -> FFmpeg audio extraction -> Whisper large-v2 (speech-to-text, Hindi->English translation)
        |
Text chunks with timestamps (7,252 real chunks)
        |
BGE-M3 embeddings (1024-dim) via Ollama
        |
   +----------------+----------------+
   |                                 |
FAISS IVF-Flat dense search    BM25 keyword search
   |                                 |
   +----------------+----------------+
                     |
       Reciprocal Rank Fusion (merges both ranked lists)
                     |
       Cross-encoder reranking (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2)
                     |
           LLaMA 3.2 (via Ollama) generates the answer
                     |
              Answer + video timestamp
```

## Measured Results

| Metric | Result | How it was measured |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| Dataset | 7,252 real chunks, 18 lecture videos | Loaded directly from `embeddings.joblib` |
| FAISS search speed | **57x faster** than brute-force cosine similarity | Benchmarked: 11.95ms -> 0.21ms per query, same dataset |
| Embedding dimension | 1024 (BGE-M3) | Verified directly from the saved embedding vectors |
| Retrieval correctness | FAISS results match brute-force top-5 exactly in most queries; the rare 1-result difference is the expected recall/speed trade-off of approximate search | Verified by cross-checking both methods on multiple real queries |
| End-to-end query latency (retrieval + LLM generation) | **2.57s** steady-state (5.67s on first query, due to one-time model load) | Measured directly: `total_duration` from two real queries against the live pipeline |

## Why hybrid retrieval (FAISS + BM25 + reranking)
- **FAISS (dense/semantic)** catches meaning-based matches even with no shared words.
- **BM25 (sparse/keyword)** reliably catches exact technical terms (e.g. "z-index") that dense embeddings sometimes under-rank.
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** combines both ranked lists without needing to normalize incompatible score scales.
- **Cross-encoder reranking** re-scores the top ~15 fused candidates by reading the query and each chunk together, catching relationships separate-embedding search misses. Too slow to run on all 7,252 chunks, so it only runs on the shortlist - the standard "retrieve cheap, rerank precise" pattern.
